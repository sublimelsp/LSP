# Customisation of the popups

LSP uses [mdpopups](https://github.com/facelessuser/sublime-markdown-popups) to display the popup. You can override its style by creating a `Packages/User/mdpopups.css` file. See the [mdpopups documentation](http://facelessuser.github.io/sublime-markdown-popups/) for more details.
