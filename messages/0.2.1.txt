=> 0.2.1

Now tested with Julia, Ocaml/Reason, and Go.
Many new settings to tweak, and per-project client configuration.
Autocomplete no longer hides built-in completions, and passes all completion requests to the language server.

See https://github.com/tomv564/LSP/releases/tag/0.2.1 for full update details.

Many thanks to those reporting issues and bugs, and a special thanks to the contributors of this release!
