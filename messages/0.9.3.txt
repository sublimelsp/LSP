=> 0.9.3


Features:

* Support for multiple folders per window. The behaviour is now:

    * Server with workspaceFolders support: One per window.
    * Server without workspaceFolders support: One per project folder

* New server logging panel (@rwols, https://github.com/tomv564/LSP/pull/811)
  * Run **LSP: Toggle Panel: Language Servers** to see it in action (if you have logging enabled)


Fixes:

* Enable workspace/configuration client capability (fixes intelephense configuration)

* Completions should be presented earlier and not show outdated results (https://github.com/tomv564/LSP/pull/822)

* Avoid completion insertion logic when out of range (@randy3k)


New server support or documentation:

* Updated Python language server instructions (@OlegSmelov)


Deprecations:

* `quick_panel_monospace_font` setting (always uses default Sublime font now)
