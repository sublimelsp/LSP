=> 0.9.4


Features:

* When using any of the various "goto" variants, a quick panel is now shown
  when the language server returns multiple locations. Before this, we took
  the first location and jumped to that location. (@mrbrian)


Fixes:

* Workspace-aware and workspace-unaware language servers are attached to views
  outside the workspace (rather than only for views inside the workspace).

* Language servers that crash during initialize are disabled for the folder
  of the sublime-project that they were initially started in, instead of
  disabling them for the entire window.

* Fix a bug for workspace-unaware language servers where if you had at least
  two folders in your sublime-project, and one is contained in the other, the
  wrong folder would be reported as the rootUri in the initialize request.

* textDocument/willSave is now sent before saving the view if the language
  server is interested in this notification.

* textDocument/didSave now includes the content of the view if the language
  server wants it.

* The tests/ folder is now part of the export-ignore attribute in the
  .gitattributes file, so the .sublime-package file that you installed through
  Package Control will be smaller.


New server support or documentation:

* Adjusted default configurations for lsp-tsserver,
  javascript-typescript-stdio, and typescript-language-server. (@plinss)

* Document next/prev diagnostics in key bindings
  As an alternative to the "diagnostics panel", you can also tab through the
  errors/warnings in the view via SublimeText phantoms. (@pedragnikolic)

* Add Fortran language server (@jwortmann)

* Refreshed and enhanced documentation: https://lsp.readthedocs.io/en/latest
