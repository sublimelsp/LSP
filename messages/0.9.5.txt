New settings:

* "initialize_timeout": The number of seconds we wait for a language server
  to initialize before we consider it "faulty" and disable it for the
  workspace folder. The default is 3 seconds.

Fixes:

* Renamed lsp_toggle_server_panel and lsp_show_diagnostics_panel to something
  more memorable (@pedragnikolic)

* Fix accumulation in reference quick panel (@Anaminus)

* Fix an exception being thrown when no diagnostics were present and hitting
  F8.
