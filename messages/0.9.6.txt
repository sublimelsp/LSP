=> 0.9.6

Documentation:

* Improve python-language-server installation command
  https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP/pull/896 (@AmjadHD)

* The rust analyzer binary was renamed from ra_lsp_server to rust-analyzer.
  If you haven't updated rust-analyzer, now would be a good time!
  The "clients" key was also renamed from ra_lsp_server to rust-analyzer.
  so if you were using any overrides in your User/LSP.sublime-settings
  file, please update that, too.

Fixes:

* All the "Go To" variants re-use an already open view.
  Previously, if you had the target view in another pane open,
  LSP would open another view in the pane from where you ran
  "Go To xxx".

* Prevent a race condition when iterating over the open documents.

* Be more lenient about non-existing workspace folders.
  SublimeText ignores folders that don't exist in your .sublime-project,
  so we do that too now.

* Fixes for the Julia language server:
  1) Allow for request IDs that aren't integers (but instead arbitrary
     strings).
  2) Improved handling of responding to specific configuration sections

* Fixes for the yaml-language-server:
  Fix point_to_offset() when Position.character > line length
  https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP/pull/904 (@jfcherng)

* The escape key is less sticky when clearing diagnostic phantoms
