=> 4070-1.1.0

Deprecated keys in your server configs
--------------------------------------

- "languages", use "selector" instead
- "languageId", use "selector" instead
- "syntaxes", use "selector" instead
- "document_selector", renaming to "selector" is sufficient
- "scopes", use "priority_selector" instead
- "feature_selector", renaming to "priority_selector" is sufficient

Basically, use "selector" to specify to which views to attach. Just like in
your Build Systems. Old configs remain backwards-compatible for now.

As always, LSP-json usage is recommended and will show you what is deprecated
and what is not deprecated.

The end goal here is to make server configurations feel more and more like your
familiar build system configurations.

New keys in your server configs
-------------------------------

- "auto_complete_selector": Fine-tune server trigger characters with a selector.
- "ignore_server_trigger_chars": Ignore server trigger characters completely,
and rely solely on "auto_complete_selector".
