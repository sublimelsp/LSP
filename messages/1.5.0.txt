=> 1.5.0

# Removed Default Client Configurations

As was mentioned in the release notes of 1.4.0, the following default
configurations have been removed:

- pyls
- dart
- elixir-ls
- flow
- jdtls
- sourcekit-lsp

For all of these, a helper package is available on packagecontrol.io that
automates the boring set up and installation of server binaries.

# Deprecated Default Client Configurations

The following default client configs are **DEPRECATED** and **WILL BE REMOVED**:

- haskell-ide-engine -> set up haskell-language-server instead, see
  lsp.sublimetext.io for instructions
- rlang -> use the R-IDE package, which provides an LSP client configuration
  under the hood.

# New Example Configurations

An example client configuration for "diagnostic-language-server" has been added
to lsp.sublimetext.io. It is a general-purpose language server which allows
you to hook up any command-line linter program or formatter program. It can be
regarded as a replacement of SublimeLinter. There is an example set up for the
shellcheck program to lint your Bash source code.

# New Settings

- Use show_code_actions_in_hover to disable code actions in the hover popup.
- Use show_diagnostics_highlights to disable inline diagnostics in the view.

# Removed Settings

- diagnostics_highlights_style is replaced by show_diagnostics_highlights.
