# Removed Default Configurations

As was mentioned in the release notes of 1.5, the following default
configurations are now removed:

- haskell-ide-engine
  -> use haskell-language-server, see lsp.sublimetext.io for instructions
- rlang
  -> use the LSP-R helper package: https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP-R

# New Helper Packages

- LSP-R: https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP-R
- LSP-Deno: https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP-Deno

# Features and Fixes

- Fix a bug where code actions would be requested for transient
  views (Raoul Wols)
- Clear all status messages when session ends (Janos Wortmann)
  This fixes a bug where if you disable the LSP package while
  a language server is reporting server-initiated progress, the
  progress message would remain visible in the Status Bar.
- CI is once again enabled (#1679) (Raoul Wols)
- os.path.relpath may throw an exception on Windows (Raoul Wols)
  This fixes a bug where if you use Find References on Windows,
  the response handler could fail by not catching this exception.
- Rename code_action_on_save_timeout_ms to
  on_save_task_timeout_ms (#1728) (Rafał Chłodnicki)
  This allows you to adjust the timeout for formatting as well.
