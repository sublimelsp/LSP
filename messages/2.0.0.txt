=> 2.0.0

⚠️ Sublime Text will need to be restarted **more than once** for things to work properly. ⚠️

# Breaking changes

- LSP and LSP-* packages are transitioning from Python 3.3 to Python 3.8.

# FAQ

### What are the most significant improvements that stem from the 3.3 to 3.8 change?

There are no new features.
This is an internal LSP codebase change that affects all LSP-* packages.

### LSP is broken after the update even if Sublime Text is restarted many times

If that is the case, follow these steps:

- ##### Check if `"index_files"` is set to `false` in `Preferences.sublime-settings`

From the command palette open `Preferences: Settings` and see if `"index_files": false` exists.
If yes, remove that setting.

- ##### Check if `"LSP"` is put in `"ignored_packages"` in `Preferences.sublime-settings`

Ensure that LSP hasn't been added to the "ignored_packages" list during the update. If it has, remove it.
