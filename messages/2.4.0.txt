# Breaking changes

- The language-ids.sublime-settings configuration file has been deprecated and will be removed in the next minor release of LSP. The language IDs are
  hardcoded now. Language IDs are used by servers which handle more than one language to avoid
  re-interpreting file extensions. If you used the configuration file and think that a language ID
  is wrong or missing, please follow this migration guide https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP/issues/2592.
