* DEPRECATION:
  The "syntaxes" and "scopes" keys in your server configurations are deprecated.
  They have been replaced by "document_selector" and "feature_selector", respectively.

  Here's how it works: if the document_selector is "source.foo", then the language
  server will be assigned to views that match that selector for their base scope.

  For instance, put "document_selector": "source.rust" for Rust files.

  Given an LSP Language ID $langID, the document_selector is most likely of the form
  "source.$langID". Because this is often the case, you can leave out the
  "document_selector" key altogether.

  The "feature_selector" is used to differentiate between two language servers when
  a frontend feature requires only a single language server. When the "feature_selector"
  is missing, it will be the same as the "document_selector". You most likely won't
  ever need to touch the feature_selector, except for HTML language servers.

  A full example:

  "clients":
  {
    "rust-analyzer":
    {
        "command": ["rust-analyzer"],
        // no need for a document_selector as it will match source.rust
        "languages": [{"languageId": "rust"}]
    },
    "intelephense":
    {
        "command": ["intelephense", "--stdio"],
        "languages": [{"languageId": "php", "document_selector": "embedding.php | source.php"}]
    }
  }

  The document_selector and feature_selector are, as the name suggests, selectors:

  The "syntaxes" and "scopes" keys will continue to work for a while, but support will
  drop for them in the future.
