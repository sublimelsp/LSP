=> 4070-1.0.5

Modified default keybindings:
- The default keybinding for "code actions" (ctrl+. or super+.) was in
  conflict with ST's "Next Modification" keybinding (which you can find
  in the Goto menu). The default keybinding for "code actions" is
  removed and you'll have to set it up yourself. Run the command

      "Preferences: LSP Keybindings"

  to configure your keybindings.

Features and bugfixes:
- Do not override the built-in "Next Modification" keybinding (Raoul Wols)
- Fixup: Missing show_diagnostics_severity_level functionality (Raoul Wols)
- Only publish diags when the diagnostics version is up-to-date (Raoul Wols)
- Use the escapeall markdown extension to handle \< and \> in markdown (Raoul Wols)
