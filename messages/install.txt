This package provides Sublime Text support for the Language Server Protocol.

Run "LSP: Enable Language Server" in the command palette to enable a configured server.

You can further add / configure your language servers in LSP's Package Settings.

For improved functionality, adding autocomplete triggers and keybindings is recommended.

See https://lsp.readthedocs.io/ for documentation.

For an up-to-date list of language servers, see http://langserver.org/#implementations-server
