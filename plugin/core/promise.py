class Promise:
    """A simple implementation of the Promise specification.

    See: https://promisesaplus.com

    Promise is in essence a syntactic sugar for callbacks. Simplifies passing
    values from functions that might do work in asynchronous manner.

    Example usage:

      * Passing return value of one function to another:

        def do_work_async(resolve):
            # "resolve" is a function that, when called with a value, resolves
            # the promise with provided value and passes the value to the next
            # chained promise.
            resolve(111)  # Can be invoked asynchronously.

        def process_value(value):
            assert value === 111

        Promise(do_work_async).then(process_value)

      * Returning Promise from chained promise:

        def do_work_async_1(resolve):
            # Compute value asynchronously.
            resolve(111)

        def do_work_async_2(resolve):
            # Compute value asynchronously.
            resolve(222)

        def do_more_work_async(value):
            # Do more work with the value asynchronously. For the sake of this
            # example, we don't use 'value' for anything.
            assert value === 111
            return Promise(do_work_async_2)

        def process_value(value):
            assert value === 222
