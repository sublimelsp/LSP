""" Position in a text document expressed as zero-based line and character

representation. So a string of the form `a𐐀b` the character offset of the
character `a` is 0, the character offset of `𐐀` is 1 and the character
offset of b is 3 since `𐐀` is represented using two code units in UTF-16.
Since 3.17 clients and servers can agree on a different string encoding
representation (e.g. UTF-8). The client announces it's supported encoding
via the client capability [`general.positionEncodings`](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#clientCapabilities).
The value is an array of position encodings the client supports, with
decreasing preference (e.g. the encoding at index `0` is the most preferred
one). To stay backwards compatible the only mandatory encoding is UTF-16
represented via the string `utf-16`. The server can pick one of the
encodings offered by the client and signals that encoding back to the
client via the initialize result's property
[`capabilities.positionEncoding`](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#serverCapabilities). If the string value
`utf-16` is missing from the client's capability `general.positionEncodings`
servers can safely assume that the client supports UTF-16. If the server
omits the position encoding in its initialize result the encoding defaults
to the string value `utf-16`. Implementation considerations: since the
conversion from one encoding into another requires the content of the
file / line the conversion is best done where the file is read which is
usually on the server side.

Positions are line end character agnostic. So you can not specify a position
that denotes `\r|\n` or `\n|` where `|` represents the character offset.
