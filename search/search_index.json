This is a specification for the communication protocol for use between text editors or IDEs and language servers - tools which provide language-specific features like autocomplete, go to definition, or documentation on hover. As the so called LSP client this package acts as an interface between Sublime Text and your language server, which means that to obtain these features you need to install a server for your language first. Language servers can be provided as standalone executables or require a runtime environment like Node.js or Python. For various languages you can find a community maintained helper package with an <code>LSP-</code> name prefix on Package Control. These packages allow to install and update a particular language server automatically, to setup a default configuration with server specific settings, and they may also provide additional features for servers which use a custom extension of the language server protocol. Alternatively, a language server can be installed manually and the necessary configuration can be added directly into the <code>LSP.sublime-settings</code> file; see the Client Configuration page for details.</p> <p>Many new concepts not native to Sublime Text are in use. For an overview of these concepts, please see the Features page.</p>"},{"location":"#projects-workspace-folders","title":"Projects &amp; Workspace Folders","text":"<p>This LSP client supports to run multiple active servers at the same time for a single file type. For example in a Python project you could use LSP-pyright for general features (autocomplete, go to definition, etc.) and simultaneously LSP-ruff for additional linter warnings. In case you want to run multiple servers with a similar set of features at the same time, it is possible to prioritize one of the servers by disabling some of the features for the other server(s) using the <code>\"disabled_capabilities\"</code> setting in the Client Configuration.</p> <p>An instance of a language server is always bound to a single window in Sublime Text. Note that this means if you move a file tab handled by a language server out of a window, a new instance of that server will be started, or if it was moved into another window where the corresponding server was already running, then it will be managed by that other server instance. In other words you can have multiple projects open at the same time in different windows and each of them gets managed by its own language server instance.</p> <p>\"Workspace\" and \"workspace folders\" are terms from VS Code and they are also used in the LSP specification. Basically a workspace corresponds to a window in Sublime Text and the workspace folders are just the folders which are opened in the sidebar. The window does not necessarily need to be associated with a Sublime project, but sometimes this can be useful for project-specific configurations, see Per-project overrides. There can be multiple workspace folders, or even none if you just open individual files in the active window. When a language server starts, it is notified about the workspace folders and many servers use them to look for configuration files, for instance <code>Cargo.toml</code> in Rust or <code>pyproject.toml</code> in a Python project. So for project-based programming languages you typically want to have the root folder of your project opened as a folder in the sidebar.</p> <p>If a file from outside the workspace folders is opened in the same window (for example manually, or when using \"Goto Definition\"), most LSP features should still work in that file. However, note that diagnostic messages are filtered out for such files unless explicitly configured differently in the client configuration for that server.</p>"},{"location":"#server-settings-initialization-options","title":"Server Settings &amp; Initialization Options","text":"<p>A language server may expose settings that you can use to customize its behavior.

This section is only relevant if you want to add a new client configuration for a server that doesn't have a corresponding helper package.</p> <p>After you have installed a language server, the LSP settings need to be configured to enable communication between LSP and that server for suitable filetypes. LSP ships with configurations for a few language servers, but these need to be enabled before they will start. To globally enable a server, open the Command Palette and choose \"LSP: Enable Language Server Globally\". This will add <code>\"enabled\": true</code> to the corresponding language server setting under the <code>\"clients\"</code> key in your user-settings file for LSP. Your user-settings file is stored at <code>Packages/User/LSP.sublime-settings</code> and can be opened via \"Preferences &gt; Package Settings &gt; LSP &gt; Settings\" from the menu or with the <code>Preferences: LSP Settings</code> command from the Command Palette.

It's a selector that is matched against the current view's base scope. If the selector matches with the base scope of the the file, the associated language server is started. For more information, see https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/selectors.html priority_selector Used to prioritize a certain language server when choosing which one to query on views with multiple servers active. Certain LSP actions have to pick which server to query and this setting can be used to decide which one to pick based on the current scopes at the cursor location. For example when having both HTML and PHP servers running on a PHP file, this can be used to give priority to the HTML one in HTML blocks and to PHP one otherwise. That would be done by setting \"priority_selector\" to <code>text.html</code> for HTML server and <code>source.php</code> to PHP server. Note: when the \"priority_selector\" is missing, it will be the same as the \"document_selector\". diagnostics_mode Set to <code>\"workspace\"</code> (default is <code>\"open_files\"</code>) to ignore diagnostics for files that are not within the project (window) folders. If project has no folders then this option has no effect and diagnostics are shown for all files. If the server supports pull diagnostics (<code>diagnosticProvider</code>), this setting also controls whether diagnostics are requested only for open files (<code>\"open_files\"</code>), or for all files in the project folders (<code>\"workspace\"</code>). tcp_port see instructions below experimental_capabilities Turn on experimental capabilities of a language server.

You can see what ST thinks your <code>PATH</code> is by opening the ST console by clicking on View &gt; Show Console, and running <code>import os; os.environ[\"PATH\"]</code> in that console.</p> <p>The solution is to make ST use the same <code>PATH</code> that is read by your shell (or OS in general in the case of Windows).</p> <p>Adjusting <code>PATH</code> can differ based on the operating system and the default shell used. Refer to the following table on where this should be adjusted:</p> Windows Open Start Menu, type \"environment\" and select \"Edit environment variables for your account\". Modify the \"Path\" variable so that it includes the directory path to the program of your choice. macOS Depending on your default shell (macOS ships with zsh shell by default), edit: <code>~/.zprofile</code> (zsh), <code>~/.profile</code> (bash) or <code>~/.config/fish/config.fish</code> (fish). Linux Edit <code>~/.profile</code>. <p>For macOS and Linux you can extend the path like so:</p> <pre><code>export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"\n</code></pre> <p>For package managers like <code>nvm</code> (Node version manager), the recommended way is to insert its initialization script in the respective location specified above.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>On macOS, it's enough to restart ST for the changes to be picked up. On other platforms, you might have to re-login your user account.</p> <p>Another solution could be (at least on Linux) to update the server <code>PATH</code> using the <code>env</code>parameter in your LSP configuration file. The following template can be used where:</p> <ul> <li><code>&lt;your_language_server_name&gt;</code> is the server name</li> <li><code>&lt;added_path&gt;</code> is the directory needed for the server to behave correctly</li> </ul> <pre><code>\"&lt;your_language_server_name&gt;\":\n{\n    // ...\n\n    \"env\":\n    {\n        \"PATH\": \"&lt;added_path&gt;:/usr/local/bin\"\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#common-problems","title":"Common problems","text":""},{"location":"troubleshooting/#error-dialog-saying-failed-to-start","title":"Error dialog saying <code>Failed to start...</code>","text":"<p>If you are getting an error that the server binary can't be found (<code>No such file or directory...</code>) but it does start when Sublime Text is started from the terminal, then the issue is likely due to Sublime Text's internal environment not picking up the same <code>PATH</code> environment variable as you've configured in your shell.
